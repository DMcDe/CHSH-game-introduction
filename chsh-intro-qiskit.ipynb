    "# Quantum Computing and the CHSH Game -- An Introduction with Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter noteboook introduces some basic concepts in quantum computing via a quantum game, demonstrating one way in which quantum mechanics can be used to achieve performance surpassing classical strategies. It begins with a brief introduction to background concepts and the game itself, and then lets you play the game and explore how quantum concepts can improve your strategy. It should take around 10 minutes, and requires no background knowledge of quantum computing. \n",

    "If you have a working installation of Jupyter and Qiskit, you can simply run this notebook in Jupyter. If not, Google colab is a great option: simply go to the site (https://colab.research.google.com), sign in with google, and upload this notebook, then proceed."

    "# Introduction to Quantum Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is an emerging area of research and technology centered on building computers that utilize novel features of quantum mechanics, the study of physics at microscopic scales. While the technology is still in its infancy, if scaled, it would enable us to solve problems that are far too complex for even the most powerful classical computers to solve efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical computers operate with bits -- pieces of information that can be in just one of two states, either a 0 or a 1 (often corresponding to off and on). These bits are operated on via circuits -- pieces of hardware made up of gates that can change the value of individual bits or do logical operations. For example, one of the most simple gates is the \"NOT\" gate, which returns the opposite of whatever bit it is given (if given a 0 it returns a 1 and vise versa). Other simple gates include the \"AND\" gate, which receives two input bits and returns a 1 if both input bits are a 1, and the \"XOR\" gate (read \"exclusive or\"), which takes in two bits and returns a 1 if its inputs are different and a 0 if they are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers operate similarly, but with one defining difference: while classical bits must always be either a 0 or a 1, quantum bits (or \"qubits,\" for short) are able to be somewhere in between; qubits can have some probability of being a 0 and some probability of being a 1. This is made possible because of a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics: superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum superposition is the principle that if a particle can be in multiple different states at a given time, it is most accurately thought of as in some combination of those states. When the particle is then measured or observed, it collapses down to just one of those states, based on a probability distribution. You may be familiar with the \"Schrödinger's cat\" thought experiment, in which a cat in a box is both dead and alive until the box is opened -- that relies on the same principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another quantum concept that is utilized in quantum computers is called entanglement. Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where two spatially separated particles are found to have correlating attributes. Experiments have measured the spin of multiple particles, many miles apart, and found that their measurements instantly correlate, faster than the speed of light. By cleverly using quantum gates, quantum computers can create entangled states between bits, causing their properties to seemingly synchronize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to simulate quantum circuits in this notebook utilizes Qiskit, an open source software development kit for quantum computing developed by IBM. If interested in learning more about quantum computing, there are many free, beginner-friendly tutorials on the basics of coding in Qiskit."

    "# The CHSH Game\n",
    "One application of quantum principles and quantum computing is in quantum games. In these games, taking advantage of phenomena like entanglement enables players to win more often than they would be able to otherwise. Here, we'll introduce the CHSH game (named after its inventors: John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt), and explain how quantum computing can enhance players' strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH game involves two players and a referee. The players, whom we'll call Alice and Bob, are cooperating to win. The game goes as follows: Alice and Bob will be separated, then both given some input by the referee, either a 0 or 1. Each player knows only their input, not their partner's. After getting their input, will both return an output of their choice to the referee, also a 0 or a 1. Alice and Bob win if they satisfy the following condition: \n",
    "\n",
    "alice_input * bob_input = alice_output ⊕ bob_output\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, this means that if Alice's input multipled by Bob's input is 0, Alice and Bob should return the same output (the symbol on the right indicates the XOR operation described above). If Alice and Bob's inputs multiplied together are equal to 1, they should return different outputs. For example, if Alice receives a 0 and Bob receives a 1, they would win if they both returned the same number (since 0 * 1 = 0), but would lose if they returned different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After being told the rules, Alice and Bob are allowed to briefly discuss and come up with a strategy. They are then separated, and the game begins."

    "# The Quantum Strategy\n",
    "As you may have discovered, the optimal classical strategy is for both players to always return the same number, no matter what their input was. If they do so, they should win roughly 75% of the time, since any time either player was given input 0, the product of their inputs would be 0. That's nothing to scoff at, but by utilizing quantum entanglement, Alice and Bob can actually up their win percentage to 85%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say Alice and Bob are about to play the CHSH game again. They've just finished their first quantum mechanics class, however, which has given them an idea for a new strategy. They recall that the measurements of two entangled qubits are correlated, and think they can use this to their advantage. Before the game starts, Alice and Bob share an EPR pair (also called a Bell state), a common example of an entangled state with two qubits. Before being separated, Alice and Bob set up a simple quantum circuit to entangle two qubits, and both take one of them qubits with them. Then, both add a gate to their branch of the circuit depending on the input they received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's job is simple: if she receives a 0, she directly measures her qubit, without applying any gates; if she receives a 1, she applies a Hadamard gate to her qubit, which puts it in a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩, and then measures it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob's is a little more complicated: he will apply the same unitary gate to his qubit no matter what he receives, but with a slightly different angle as a phase shift. If Bob receives a 0, he will use the angle π/8 radians for θ; if he receives a 1, he will use the angle -π/8 radians. (For those with a background in linear algebra, Bob's gate maps |0⟩ to cos(θ)|0⟩ + sin(θ)|1⟩, and maps |1⟩ to sin(θ)|0⟩ - cos(θ)|1⟩).\n",
