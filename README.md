# CHSH-game-introduction
An introduction to the CHSH game with two modules:

1. An interactive introduction on Qiskit, intended for beginners. This notebook is perfect for those with no background in quantum computing: it introduces the necessary concepts in simple terms, and then lets the user play through the game with different strategies before demonstrating the superiority of the optimal quantum strategy to the optimal classic strategy.

2. (WIP) A simulation of the game on SeQUeNCe, a quantum network simulator. Currently, the simulation works, but does not demonstrate SeQUeNCe's capabilities. New features are in the works.
