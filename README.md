# CHSH-game-introduction
An introduction to the CHSH game with two modules:

1. An interactive introduction on Qiskit, intended for beginners. This notebook is perfect for those with no background in quantum computing: it introduces the necessary concepts in simple terms, and then lets the user play through the game with different strategies before demonstrating the superiority of the optimal quantum strategy to the optimal classic strategy.

2. A simulation of the game on SeQUeNCe, a quantum network simulator. The simulation lets the user simulate playing games in a perfect quantum network, as well as in a quantum network with various sources of noise, including imperfect entanglement and imperfect measurement fidelity. The simulation demonstrates that the 85% win rate associated with the optimal quantum strategy is theoretically achievable on a real world quantum network, but requires reducing error on various parts of the network.
